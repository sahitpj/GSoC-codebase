# Code base of the GSoC 2019 project 'DBpedia Triple Extractor'

This is the code base for my Google Summer of Code 2019 project under DBpedia entitled 'Tool to generate RDF triples from DBpedia abstracts'. There is a web application using this code base at [github.com/sahitpj/TE-webapp](https://github.com/sahitpj/TE-webapp). 

The blog to the following project can be found at [`https://sahitpj.github.io/gs` ](https://sahitpj.github.io/gs). The following submodules are modifications of the forks of their projects.
